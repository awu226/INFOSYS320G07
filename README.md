INFOSYS 320 Group 7 project

PC Standalone Exe Folder 

Contains the exe for windows - use this to run the prototype :) 


Auckland Museum - Unity Project

1) Open Unity 
2) Select "Auckland Museum" 
3) Go to "Scenes" folder 
4) Open "Title"
5) Click Play :) - using the resolution 1700 X 800 gives the best user experience 


Or you can download the exe from : 

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BxGmrGjm1JssQldQajVQSVBrV3M?usp=sharing

(you will need both the folder and the exe to run the exe properly)

Also, a good wifi connection is important as data is getting pulled from the database at runtime.
